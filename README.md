# CUDA_Kernels

This repository is a personal log of my journey through the 100 Days of CUDA challenge. Alongside this, I am also studying Programming Massively Parallel Processors (PMPP) to deepen my understanding of GPU architecture and parallel programming concepts.

Mentor: https://github.com/hkproj/

## Day 1 – CUDA Vector Addition kernel

- Implemented vector addition on both **CPU** and **GPU** using CUDA  
- Achieved ~**26.9× speedup** with CUDA kernel over CPU
- Started translating the kernel into Triton (in progress, will continue tomorrow)
- Read Chapter 1

## Day 2 – Triton Vector Addition kernel

- Implemented vector addition again, but using Triton
- Achieved ~4–8× speedup with Triton kernel over PyTorch CPU operation
- Read Chapter 2 from 2.1-2.4

## Day 3 – CUDA Matrix Addition kernel

- Implemented vector addition on both **CPU** and **GPU** using CUDA  
- Achieved ~**100× speedup** with CUDA kernel over CPU

## Day 4 – N/A
- Finished Chapter 2
