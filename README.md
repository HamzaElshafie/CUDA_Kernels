# CUDA_Kernels

This repository is a personal log of my journey through the 100 Days of CUDA challenge. Alongside this, I am also studying Programming Massively Parallel Processors (PMPP) to deepen my understanding of GPU architecture and parallel programming concepts.

Mentor: https://github.com/hkproj/

## Day 1 – Vector Addition 

- Implemented vector addition on both **CPU** and **GPU** using CUDA  
- Achieved **26.9× speedup** with CUDA kernel over CPU
